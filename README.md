# portfolio

A portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. I have linked you to a web page that I intend to actually use as my portfolio. As we continue to work on projects in this boot camp, I intend to be able to show the deployed web applications. I plan to be very successful in my career search after the boot camp.

I am currently working with career counselors to make all of this happen for me.
